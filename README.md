# Bs_f0mumu
#Before Filter: total cross section = 5.524e+08 +- 5.496e+06 pb
#Filter efficiency (taking into account weights)= (66) / (10000) = 6.600e-03 +- 8.097e-04
#Filter efficiency (event-level)= (66) / (10000) = 6.600e-03 +- 8.097e-04    [TO BE USED IN MCM]

#After filter: final cross section = 3.646e+06 +- 4.487e+05 pb
#After filter: final fraction of events with negative weights = 0.000e+00 +- 0.000e+00
#After filter: final equivalent lumi for 1M events (1/fb) = 2.743e-04 +- 3.376e-05
